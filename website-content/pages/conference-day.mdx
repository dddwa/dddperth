## Getting There

Our [Venue](/venue) page has more information on how to get to the conference.

## Code of Conduct

Please familiarize yourself with the [Conference Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct).

All attendees, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers at our conference are required to agree with the code of conduct. Organizers and volunteers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe, welcoming environment for everybody.

### What to do if someone makes a complaint about you?

-   DDD Perth organizers and volunteers will have a conversation with you and listen to you.
-   Listen to the complaint with an open mind and consider the effect rather than the intent of the behavior in question.
-   Don't be dismissive of the complainant.
-   Understand any advice given on how to act in the future.
-   Comply with the directions of the DDD Perth organizers and volunteers.

We believe everyone here is coming from a good place, and so we expect that you're learning, just like we are.

## Getting Help

### Issues & Questions

Please feel free to speak to a member of the DDD Perth team who will be easily identifiable by their Volunteer DDD Perth t-shirts and Event Management name badges.

We'll identify the organizers and volunteers during the Welcome, and there will also be a help desk next to registration, attended at all times by members from our wonderful team.
